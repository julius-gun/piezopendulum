The developed device serves as a practical model to demonstrate the piezoelectric phenomena.
By using a linear piezoelectric actuator with inherent sensing capabilities, it eliminates the need
for auxiliary sensors to detect an approaching ball. Suspended from a string, the ball touches
the actuator, which propels it outward. Upon its return, the device detects the incoming impulse
and prevents the ball from rebounding. This development is based in part on Moldovan's fundamental work (1993), 
while redesigning many aspects.
